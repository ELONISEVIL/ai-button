Bash
pip install transformers
Use code with caution.

2. Create a JavaScript Function:

JavaScript
document.getElementById("ai-button").addEventListener("click", function() {
  const userInput = document.getElementById("user-input").value;
  fetch("/analyze_sentiment", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text: userInput })
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    document.getElementById("ai-response").textContent Â  
 = data.sentiment;
  });
});
Use code with caution.

3. Create a Flask Route:

Python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from transformers import pipeline

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/analyze_sentiment", methods=["POST"])
def analyze_sentiment():
  data = request.get_json()
  text = data["text"]

  # Load pre-trained sentiment analysis model
  nlp = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

  # Analyze the text
  result = nlp(text)

  return jsonify({"sentiment": result[0]["label"]})
Use code with caution.

Paste the Code
JavaScript: Paste the JavaScript code directly into your HTML file, within the <script> tags.
Python: Paste the Python code into your Flask application's Python file.
Ensure you have the necessary HTML elements (e.g., user-input, ai-response) in your HTML file to display the results.# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
